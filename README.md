 The project is a part of journey to start my career in the field of data science. I have tried to perform an EDA on the Breast Cancer data set. 

**Objective** -- To understand the survival status based on Age, No of Aux Nodes and Operation Year. 

**Problem Statement**

1. What is the age of the patient getting infected?
2. Relationship of variable(Age, Nodes and Years of Operation) with rest to Survival?
3. In Which years most successful operations were conducted?
4. Which factors contributes most to the survival?

### **Brief about Breast Cancer**

Breast Cancer

It is a type of Cancer that starts in Breast. It happens because the cells insie the breast starts growing oiut of control and starts forming a lump.

Where breast cancer starts

Breast cancers can start from different parts of the breast.

-   Most breast cancers begin in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancers)
-   Some start in the glands that make breast milk (lobular cancers)
-   There are also other types of breast cancer that are less common like phyllodes tumor and angiosarcoma
-   A small number of cancers start in other tissues in the breast. These cancers are called sarcomas and lymphomas and are not really thought of as breast cancers.
